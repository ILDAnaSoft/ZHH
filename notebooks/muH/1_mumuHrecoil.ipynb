    "At the same time, our current understanding of the universe is incomplete: How did the universe form after the Big Bang? What really _is_ dark matter? There exist theories which try to answer these questions by connecting them with our incomplete knowledge of the Higgs boson. As experimentalists, we can only proove (or rule out) these scenarios if we measure the properties of the Higgs boson with high precision. This is what we're going to do in the following. Our goal will be to measure the Higgs boson mass."
